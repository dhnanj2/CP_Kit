/*
Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split its set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B, such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists. Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1. There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

*/

/*
We are trying to split the graph into two groups of edges.
So we color the edges, 1 = red, -1 = blue, 0 = not colored yet.
A graph is bipartite if and only if the two ends of each edge have different colors.
